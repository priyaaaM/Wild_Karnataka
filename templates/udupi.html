        <p>Udupi, a beautiful coastal town in Karnataka, is known for its rich cultural heritage, ancient temples, and
            serene beaches. Famous for its iconic Udupi Sri Krishna Temple, the town draws devotees and tourists alike.

            of spirituality and coastal charm.<span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="more">Udupi is not just about temples; it is also famous for its cuisine, particularly the
                Udupi-style vegetarian food that has won hearts globally. The Malpe beach, with its golden sands, and
                the St. Mary's Island, with its unique hexagonal basalt rock formations, are popular tourist spots.
                Udupiâ€™s historical significance also comes from being a prominent center for learning and culture,
                especially with the rise of the Udupi Mathas (monastic institutions). With its pleasant coastal climate,
                vibrant culture, and beautiful landscapes, Udupi remains one of the most cherished destinations along
                the Western Coast of India.</span>
